# FourierSVGDrawing
This code draws an animation of any illustrator svg file, using fourier transform.
This project was made based on a [video from Daniel Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY4luNgGfms).

## Export the svg file
Firstly, you need to open Illustrator and create a new file.
You must use the "pen tool" and draw only <b>one</b> line <b>without</b> it beeing a <b>curve</b> (<i>you can check the path example for more informations</i>).
Then, simply export your drawing as an "svg" image called "path.svg" and copy the image to the root folder.

## Run the script and watch
Double-click on "run.bat" and watch the drawing beeing made...

## This is an example of bambi (is it you?) drawn by the program
![Sorry bambi](bambi.png?raw=true "Sorry bambi...")
